  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>I'm an artist turned coder. I have a BFA and an MFA with an emphasis in oil painting and drawing. I also hold an Art History minor. I enjoy learning the languages that speak to machines that were programmed by man. It's very meta, and very rewarding. </p>
  <p>Learning and understanding is the most important aspect in my life. I'm always challenging myself to learn, a lot. Constanty reading, listening, analyzing, and doing.</p>
